# Getter
## Junior Developer FS Code Test

###  Welcome
Congratulations on making it to the next stages of the Getter team! We thought you were a great fit and really want to see how you approach problems, research new technology and code. ðŸ¤–

There is no wrong answers on this challenge :)

We appreciate you taking the time to complete this, so we're very conscious about the time you spend. __Please do not spend more than 3 hours on this challenge.__

----

### Brief

#### Overview
Create a basic internal metrics dashboard for use in the office to view important information. As the dashboard would be displayed on a TV, it should be responsive to display as much as possible without scrolling.

##### You'll NEED to use the following libraries
These are some of the frameworks we use, anything else is all up to you :)

> **Next.js** [https://nextjs.org/]
Next.js is an open-source development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

> **TailwindCSS** [https://tailwindcss.com/]
A utility first class based css framework.

> **Chart.js** [https://www.chartjs.org/]
Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers & developers

> **Next.js** [https://nextjs.org/]
Next.js is an open-source development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

> **Ava** [https://github.com/avajs/ava]
AVA is a test runner for Node.js with a concise API, detailed error output, embrace of new language features and process isolation that lets you develop with confidence

-----

##### Full stack steps
1. Set up a project with Next.js (npm or yarn)
2. Integrate TailwindCSS
3. Create an API route on Next.js that returns the following dataset for your graphs.
4. Write a test for your API routes (test the response is the correct format)
5. Create a client-side route with the URL `/sales-dashboard`
6. Fetch your api to return the data
7. `Code`
8. Add it to your Github account and link to us :)

##### What we're looking at
- **How you understand new frameworks/libraries** _(the docs are your friend!)_
- **The quality of your code** _(copy pasting is fine, but do you understand it?)_
- **Your design eye** _(if you're frontend heavy)_
- **Sticking to the UX, but using your own design** _(The design is loose, but the UX is important)_
- **How you structure your API** _(if you're backend heavy)_
- **How you prioritise your work within a 3 hour limit** _(you won't be able to do it all, so what's important?)_
- **And your attention to detail.** _(add a little flair/pizzazz/gusto/polish, if you want!)_

#### Bonus points
- Write less code (KISS approach - Keep It Simple Stupid)
- Deploy it on Vercel ;)


#### Once you're done
Just reply to the email with your repo link - good luck! If get stuck or find something too difficult, just skip it and let us know in the email.
